## 📝 Project Description

This project represents the foundation of my journey into **Full-Stack Development**. It is a curated personal showcase designed to demonstrate my transition from foundational scripting to building modern, user-centric web interfaces.

Rather than a basic "homework" page, I have focused on implementing a **Modern Minimalist UI** using professional development standards. This project serves as a live sandbox where I document my progress in mastering the core pillars of the web: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

### ✨ Key Features
* **Responsive Architecture:** Built using a "Mobile-First" approach with CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure a seamless experience across all device sizes.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** Implemented modern design trends including backdrop filters, subtle gradients, and "Inter" typography for a premium look and feel.
* **Semantic Structure:** Developed with SEO and Accessibility in mind, using proper HTML5 tags to ensure the content is readable by both users and machines.
* **Clean Code Principles:** Focused on modular CSS and organized file structures, preparing for the transition into frameworks like React and Next.js.

### 🛠️ Core Skills Demonstrated
- **HTML5:** Mastery of document flow, semantic tagging, and link architecture.
- **CSS3:** Proficiency in Variables, Hover Effects, Transitions, and Layout Engines.
- **Version Control:** Managed via Git/GitHub to demonstrate professional workflow habits.
